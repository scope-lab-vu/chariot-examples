# Introduction

This repository contains examples of different systems modeled using the [CHARIOT-ML](https://github.com/visor-vu/chariot) (Modeling Language). Following list summarizes these examples:

1. **HelloWorld**: This example models a simple two objective system without any replication constraints. Instantiation of this system results in deployment of three components, each of different type; one component that periodically sends greeting message, another component that receives greeting message and queries for time after receiving each message, and another component that acts as a time server by serving synchronous time requests.

  *NOTE: Current implementation of CHARIOT-ML does not fully support modeling of component business logic. Therefore, most of the examples in this repository are modeled using external components, i.e., a component's business logic is treated as a black box at design-time. However, to showcase a possible approach, CHARIOT-ML partially implements the concept of CHARIOT components that provides fine-grained control for modeling component behavior and execution. CHARIOT components are partially implemented because although they can be modeled, the design-time interpreter ignores them completely. In this example, each of the aformentioned three components are modeled both as external components and CHARIOT components.*

2. **SmartParkingBasic**: This example models a simple smart parking system that consists of two objectives and two replication constraints. Since this system contains a *per node* replication constraint, the exact number of components deployed upon system instantiation is not constant and rather depends on the number of available nodes associated with the *per node* replication constraint. Although the exact number of components deployed depends on the number of nodes available, this example comprises three different types of components; one component type that requests for parking space, another component type that keeps track of available parking spaces and services parking requests, and another component type that periodically determines occupancy status of one or more parking spaces.
