# ImagingSatelliteCluster Example

This example models a cluster of fractionated satellites. Consider a platform of fractionated satellites, which is a cluster of independent satellite modules, flying in formation and communicating with each other via ad-hoc wireless networks. Each independent satellite that is part of a fractionated spacecraft cluster can come from different organization. Together these independent satellite modules provide an extensible CPS platform that facilitates sharing sensors and other computing and communication resources across multiple applications. This architecture can realize the functions of monolithic satellites at a reduced cost and with improved adaptability and robustness. Several existing and future missions use this type of architecture including NASA's Edison Demonstration of SmallSat Networks, TANDEM-X, PROBA-3, and PRISMA from Europe. In each of these missions, the cooperating fractionated satellites are expected to provide the foundations for applications, used by many, possibly concurrent missions.

Individual satellite modules of a fractionated spacecraft cluster are present in the Low Earth Orbit (LEO), where one of the basic requirements is to be able to maintain orbital flight so that they can overcome the atmospheric drag and orbit the Earth while remaining in the LEO. Each individual satellite achieves this functionality by periodically using their thrusters to adjust their position. In addition to this flight control objective, which is required to be satisfied all the time by each individual satellite, the platform of fractionated spacecraft can be used to host different applications and depending on which application is hosted, more objectives are added and new system goals are created.

The fractionated satellite cluster modeled in this example comprises three objectives and four replication constraints (see system description [here](src/edu/vanderbilt/isis/chariot/imagingsatellitecluster/System.ch)). The objectives are (1) SatelliteFlight, which instantiates the *satellite_flight* composition, (2) ClusterFlightPlanning, which instantiates the *cluster_flight_planning* composition, and (3) Imaging, which instantiates the *imaging* composition. Description of these compositions and their constituent functionalities can be found [here](src/edu/vanderbilt/isis/chariot/imagingsatellitecluster/Functionality.ch).

The *ground_manager* functionality, which is part of the *cluster_flight_planning* composition, is associated with a *per node* replication constraint for nodes of the *GroundStation* category. Similarly, the *orbit_controller* functionality, which is part of both *cluster_flight_planning* and *satellite_flight* compositions, is associated with a *per node* replication constraint for nodes of the *ImagingSatellite* and *SimpleSatellite* categories. The *satellite_bus* functionality, which is part of the *satellite_flight* composition, is associated with a *per node* replication constraint for nodes of the *ImagingSatellite* and *SimpleSatellite* categories. Finally, the *trajectory_planner* functionality, which is part of the *cluster_flight_planning* composition, is associated with a *cluster* replication with minimum of 3 and maximum of 5 replications.

Due to above described replication constraints the number of components deployed when instantiating this system depends on the number of nodes available. Although the exact number of components isn't always constant, we know that this system can only comprise of eight kinds of component types: (1) LowResolutionImageGrabber, which provides the *low_resolution_image_capture* functionality by periodically capturing low resolution images, (2) HighResolutionImageGrabber, which provides the *high_resolution_image_capture* functionality by periodically capturing high resolution images, (3) ImageProcessor, which provides the *image_processor* functionality by processing captured images, (4) TrajectoryPlanner, which provides the *trajectory_planner* functionality by planning trajectories of different satellites, (5) OrbitController, which provides the *orbit_controller* functionality by controlling a satellite's orbital motion, (6) SatelliteBus, which provides the *satellite_bus* functionality by providing access to state information, (7) GroundOperationManager, which provides the *ground_manager* functionality by sending ground commands, and (8) GroundInterface, which provides the *ground_inteface* functionality by receiving ground commands.
